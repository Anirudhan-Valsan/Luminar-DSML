1)Print numbers divisible by 3 or 5 from 1 to 20 using a for loop

2)Print numbers from 1 to 10. If a number is divisible by 4, stop the loop using a for loop and break statement:

3)Python program that accepts a word from the user and reverses it.

4)Python program to check if a given number is an Armstrong number

5)Python program to display all numbers within a range except the prime numbers.

6)Python program to check the validity of password input by users.

7)Write a program to accept a number and check whether its a perfect number or not. 
Perfect number is a number which is equal to sum of its divisors. For ex: 6, its divisors are 1,2,3.
 So sum of divisors 1+2+3 is also 6

8)Write a python program to print all permutations using those three variables Original Collection: [1, 2, 3] Collection of Permutation.
 [[3, 2, 1], [2, 3, 1], [2, 1, 3], [3, 1. 2]. [1. 3. 2]. [1, 2, 3]]

9)Count the total number of digits in a number

10)Write a python program to read four numbers (representing the four octets of an IP) and print the next five IP address
Eg:
Input:
192 168 255 252
Output

192 168 255 253  
192 168 255 254 
192 168 255 255 
192 169 0 0
