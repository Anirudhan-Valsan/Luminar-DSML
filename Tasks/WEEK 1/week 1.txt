Week 1- Topic: Identifier, Input output Function, Operators

1

Write a Python program to check if a given string is a valid identifier or not.
An identifier is valid if it starts with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_) followed by zero or more letters,
underscores, or digits (0-9).

2

Write a Python program to find all the valid identifiers in a given string. Assume that identifiers are separated by spaces.

3

Write a Python program that takes three numbers as input from the user and prints out the sum of those numbers.

4

Write a Python program to generate all possible valid identifiers of length n, where n is provided by the user. Also take n values from user. Then create possible identifiers

5

Write a Python program that takes a list of numbers as input from the user and prints out the maximum and minimum numbers in the list.

6

Write a Python program that takes two numbers as input from the user and performs arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus) on them. Display the results of each operation.

7

Create a Python program that prompts the user to enter two numbers. Compare the numbers using comparison operators (>, <, ==, !=, >=, <=) and print out the result of each comparison.

8

Create a Python program that prompts the user to enter their age and checks if they are eligible to vote. Use logical operators to check if the age is greater than or equal to 18 and less than or equal to 120. Print a message indicating whether the person can vote or not.

9

Write a program that takes inputs from user and prints the multiplication table of that number

10

Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number recursively.
