# KNN (K-Nearest-Neighbours)

# clustering algorithm

# Supervised Machine Learning

#|---------------------------------------------------------------|

# can be used for both regression and classification

# usually used for classification

# Based on distance formula - Euclidean Distance Formula

# two point (x1,y1) and (x2,y2)

# sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2)

# find k nearest neighbours and the category which is more in those neighbours is taken as the prediction

# k is given an odd number

# 1. Define Value of K
# 2.
